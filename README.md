# bcog_200_final_project

Final project for bcog200 - I plan to create an image gallery/portfolio that is interactive that houses my personal photos. I hope to be able to separate them into certain categories (urban, nature, personal). The application will strive to have a user-friendly and minimalistic design to make interactions as smooth as possible. 

Functions

1) Photogallery function (self) - This will be hte parent function that houses all of the layout features including category selections, dispaly size, resolution, and navigation buttons
2) Load functions - there will be load functions for the given amount of photos I plan on loading.
3) Display Function - Function will be used to display photos given the correct parameters within the portfolio

or 

1) Simplistic GUI where users can input photos
2) the inputted photos will then be analyzed
3) user taken to a screen where their image's camera settings are revealed
4) User's uploaded image will have the option to be converted to a film-photography look
5) there will be three options of filters that the user can choose from
