# bcog_200_final_project

DRAFT/PROPOSAL

Final project for bcog200 - I plan to create an image gallery/portfolio that is interactive that houses my personal photos. I hope to be able to separate them into certain categories (urban, nature, personal). The application will strive to have a user-friendly and minimalistic design to make interactions as smooth as possible.

Difficulties: I initially wanted to use LUT's (Lookup Tables) and XMP's to accurately replicate my presents in Adobe Lightroom, however there were way too many formatting issues because LUT's tend to require a very parrallel color structure in order to work. I left the files in the folder for reference - but they don't provide a function to my program. Instead, I used built-in python libraries to manually tweak the styling elements of images.
