# bcog_200_final_project

Final project for bcog200 - I plan to create an image gallery/portfolio that is interactive that houses my personal photos. I hope to be able to separate them into certain categories (urban, nature, personal). The application will strive to have a user-friendly and minimalistic design to make interactions as smooth as possible. 

Functions
1) Simplistic GUI where users can input photos
2) the inputted photos will then be analyzed
3) user taken to a screen where their image's camera settings are revealed
4) User's uploaded image will have the option to be converted to a film-photography look
5) there will be three options of filters that the user can choose from
