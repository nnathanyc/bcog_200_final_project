# bcog_200_final_project

Final project for bcog200 - I plan to create an image gallery/portfolio that is interactive that houses my personal photos. I hope to be able to separate them into certain categories (urban, nature, personal). The application will strive to have a user-friendly and minimalistic design to make interactions as smooth as possible.
