# bcog_200_final_project

Final project for bcog200 - I plan to create an image gallery/portfolio that is interactive that houses my personal photos. I hope to be able to separate them into certain categories (urban, nature, personal). The application will strive to have a user-friendly and minimalistic design to make interactions as smooth as possible. 

Functions

1) Photogallery function (self) - This will be hte parent function that houses all of the layout features including category selections, dispaly size, resolution, and navigation buttons
2) Load functions - there will be load functions for the given amount of photos I plan on loading.
3) Display Function - Function will be used to display photos given the correct parameters within the portfolio
